# Overview
URL Stats from Facebook uses the FQL to query the stats for any URL (including facebook pages). These can then be individually displayed via shortcodes on your posts/pages or embedding in your Wordpress template files.

## Features
* Simple interface design, showing the stats for the URL
* Each stat type is wrapped in `<span>` tags with appropriate class name, for easy CSS styling eg. `<span class="usf-likes">`
* Shortcodes for embedding in posts and pages
* Compatible with all browsers
* No coding required

## Installation
See [README.txt](README.txt) for installation instructions and further details.
